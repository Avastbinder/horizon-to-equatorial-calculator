# Overview

A Horizontal to Equatorial conversion tool written in Rust. 

Useful for Astronomy, such as getting the position of an object from the sky and converting those coordinates to Equatorial to find out what that object is.

There seems to be a lack of information online regarding this type of conversion, so I hope this will be helpful to anyone who wants to do this type of conversion.
